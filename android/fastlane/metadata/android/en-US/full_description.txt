Twake Chat is a power tool for personal and corporate communication. We focus on your comfort and security – and we’re always here to help you.

CONVENIENCE
Create group chats, start themed discussions or communicate directly with your teams, colleagues, friends or community the way you want! Chat, share files and stay in touch wherever you are – with more useful features to come.

MATRIX PROTOCOL
We implemented Matrix, an open protocol for secure decentralized communications. Try it out! 

SYNCHRONIZATION
Use Twake Chat on different devices – unlike most Matrix-based messengers, we allow you to easily access your chats both from your PC and mobile phone, regardless of the device storing the recovery key. 

SECURITY
Your information is safe with Twake Chat. To get an even more secure experience, you can enable end-to-end encryption. This way, no one will be able to access your data – not even us.

FLEXIBILITY
The Matrix protocol allows you to communicate with people both inside and outside Twake infrastructure. Chat easily inside the Matrix world and involve bridges to exchange messages with users of other instant messengers.

OPEN SOURCE
Twake Chat is Open source! Retain control of your data by hosting your own server or choosing the one you trust. Need a certain modification to your app? With Open Source, anything is possible.

FEEDBACK
We appreciate any feedback you can provide. If you find a bug or think our app lacks some important functionality, please, let us know. We will do all but impossible to help you.
