# F-Droid Repository

Our own F-Droid repository contains the Google Services which is not possible in the main F-Droid repository. Release candidates
are also published on it.

## Add Repository to F-Droid

Easiest way to add the Repository is to either **scan the QR-Code** or if you are on your phone **directly click it**.

### If the QR-Code doesn't work:

First check if you have f-droid installed. If not you can get it from: [https://f-droid.org/](https://f-droid.org/).
After you made sure you installed it and you didn't have it installed before you can try again the QR-Code.
If this still isn't working follow the next steps:

1. Open the f-droid App
2. Go to the `Settings` Tab in the Bottom bar
3. Click the `Repositories` Action
4. Click on the plus sign at the top.
5. Fill in `https://fluffychat.im/repo/stable/repo/` into the top field and `5EDB5C4395B2F2D9BA682F6A1D275170CCE5365A6FA27D2220EA8D52A6D95F07` in the bottom field.
